# `misc_docs/` folder

This is a semi-structured bunch of documentation files, that I'll probably split more coherently in future versions.

- **compiler_errors.md:** List of interesting compiler errors that a beginner probably wouldn't know how to interpret. The idea is to add new errors to provide data for a potential effort to make the crate more idiot-proof somehow. File is probably out of date.
- **reconciliation.md:** Short high-level overview of what reconciliation is and how it works.
- A three-part tutorial on using Panoramix:
  - **writing_a_component.md**
  - **event_handling.md**
  - **local_state.md**
